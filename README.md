# Wellness Works - Final Year Project

## Project Title: 
A wellness platform promoting social interaction, encouraging achievement and monitoring progression.  

## Research Question: 
Can the combination of gamification techniques and modern technology simplify the provisioning of opportunities for desirable social interaction amongst employees, assist in the achievement of business objectives and instil an increased sense of self-worth in employees.

## Project Abstract: 
A wellness program is designed to promote healthy initiatives, increase productivity, and encourage progression using motivation and recognition-based rewards. 

Wellness Works is a platform that enables social engagement, promotes interactivity, and provides feedback to users to help motivate them as they progress through their program. Gamification elements are employed to focus on behavioural changes, triggers a sense of play, and help keep users motivated.

Wellness Works enables employers to tailor wellness programsÂ that encourage desirable behavioural/lifestyle traits in their employees. These can range from healthy living, to being more socially active or maintaining a balanced lifestyle. This is achieved through the use of incentivised events that align with the desired traits. 

The creation of arbitrary events and monitoring of participation can be time consuming, the sponsoring of events can be costly and ensuring they are not abused can be challenging. Wellness Works enables employers to automate this process, monitor their return on investment and ensure they are not being taken advantage of.

Wellness Works utilises NFC allowing registration of events provided by employers. This enables the promotion and monitoring of social interactions. Creation, registration, attendance, and the subsequent analysis that follows these events is a widespread problem afflicting multi-domains. As such there is an inherit value in abstracting from the Wellness Works problem domain and making it available in a generic manner such that it is utilisable by third party services.

Wellness Works developed a mechanism to speed up and simplify attendance monitoring using NFC capabilities. This tool can be abstracted and used as a generic tool for third party applications such as Meetup.
